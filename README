This is the OpenStack Skeleton project. It serves two main purposes:

* As a template for new projects wanting to join the OpenStack project
* As a proving ground for determining best practices and common code
  for all OpenStack projects

The skeleton project is designed to show a recommended set of modules
for creating a simple WSGI server, with a versioned API, clean separation
of modules, a standard way of structuring both unit and functional tests,
configuration files, and documentation.
